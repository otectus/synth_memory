# SynthMemory - Complete Documentation

**Maintained by:** Cipher

## Philosophy & Design Principles

SynthMemory is built on several core principles that guide its design:

### 1. Semantic Continuity
> Memories should persist across sessions and adapt to evolving conversations.

### 2. Privacy by Default
> No data leaves local storage without explicit consent; PII redaction before indexing.

### 3. Graceful Degradation
> The system should degrade functionality rather than fail catastrophically.

### 4. Thread Awareness
> CPU-intensive operations must not block the UI thread or event loop.

### 5. Schema Resilience
> Databases must survive corruption, version changes, and partial failures.
